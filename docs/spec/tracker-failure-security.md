# Aiur Service Specification — Tracker, Prompts, Failure Model, Security and Checklist (§11, §12, §14, §15, §18)

Part of the [Aiur Service Specification](../../SPEC.md); section numbers are unchanged.

## 11. Issue Tracker Integration Contract (Linear-Compatible)

### 11.1 REQUIRED Operations

An implementation MUST support these tracker adapter operations:

1. `fetch_candidate_issues()`
   - Return issues in configured active states for a configured project.

2. `fetch_issues_by_states(state_names)`
   - Used for startup terminal cleanup.

3. `fetch_issue_states_by_ids(issue_ids)`
   - Used for active-run reconciliation.

### 11.2 Query Semantics (Linear)

Linear-specific requirements for `tracker.kind == "linear"`:

- `tracker.kind == "linear"`
- GraphQL endpoint (default `https://api.linear.app/graphql`)
- Auth token sent in `Authorization` header
- `tracker.project_slug` maps to Linear project `slugId`
- Candidate issue query filters project using `project: { slugId: { eq: $projectSlug } }`
- Issue-state refresh query uses GraphQL issue IDs with variable type `[ID!]`
- Pagination REQUIRED for candidate issues
- Page size default: `50`
- Network timeout: `30000 ms`

Important:

- Linear GraphQL schema details can drift. Keep query construction isolated and test the exact query
  fields/types REQUIRED by this specification.

A non-Linear implementation MAY change transport details, but the normalized outputs MUST match the
domain model in Section 4.

### 11.3 Normalization Rules

Candidate issue normalization SHOULD produce fields listed in Section 4.1.1.

Additional normalization details:

- `labels` -> lowercase strings
- `blocked_by` -> derived from inverse relations where relation type is `blocks`
- `priority` -> integer only (non-integers become null)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` -> parse ISO-8601 timestamps

### 11.4 Error Handling Contract

RECOMMENDED error categories:

- `unsupported_tracker_kind`
- `missing_tracker_api_key`
- `missing_tracker_project_slug`
- `linear_api_request` (transport failures)
- `linear_api_status` (non-200 HTTP)
- `linear_graphql_errors`
- `linear_unknown_payload`
- `linear_missing_end_cursor` (pagination integrity error)

Orchestrator behavior on tracker errors:

- Candidate fetch failure: log and skip dispatch for this tick.
- Running-state refresh failure: log and keep active workers running.
- Startup terminal cleanup failure: log warning and continue startup.

### 11.5 Tracker Writes (Important Boundary)

Aiur does not require first-class tracker write APIs in the orchestrator.

- Ticket mutations (state transitions, comments, PR metadata) are typically handled by the coding
  agent using tools defined by the workflow prompt.
- The service remains a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Workflow-specific success often means "reached the next handoff state" (for example
  `Human Review`) rather than tracker terminal state `Done`.
- If the `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented, it is still part of the agent
  toolchain rather than orchestrator business logic.

## 12. Prompt Construction and Context Assembly

### 12.1 Inputs

Inputs to prompt rendering:

- `workflow.prompt_template`
- normalized `issue` object
- OPTIONAL `attempt` integer (retry/continuation metadata)

### 12.2 Rendering Rules

- Render with strict variable checking.
- Render with strict filter checking.
- Convert issue object keys to strings for template compatibility.
- Preserve nested arrays/maps (labels, blockers) so templates can iterate.

### 12.3 Retry/Continuation Semantics

`attempt` SHOULD be passed to the template because the workflow prompt can provide different
instructions for:

- first run (`attempt` null or absent)
- continuation run after a successful prior session
- retry after error/timeout/stall

### 12.4 Failure Semantics

If prompt rendering fails:

- Fail the run attempt immediately.
- Let the orchestrator treat it like any other worker failure and decide retry behavior.

## 14. Failure Model and Recovery Strategy

### 14.1 Failure Classes

1. `Workflow/Config Failures`
   - Missing `.aiur/config`
   - Invalid YAML (non-map root)
   - Missing or unreadable `prompt_file:`
   - Unsupported tracker kind or missing tracker credentials/project slug
   - Missing coding-agent executable

2. `Workspace Failures`
   - Workspace directory creation failure
   - Workspace population/synchronization failure (implementation-defined; can come from hooks)
   - Invalid workspace path configuration
   - Hook timeout/failure

3. `Agent Session Failures`
   - Startup handshake failure
   - Turn failed/cancelled
   - Turn timeout
   - User input requested and handled as failure by the implementation's documented policy
   - Subprocess exit
   - Stalled session (no activity)

4. `Tracker Failures`
   - API transport errors
   - Non-200 status
   - GraphQL errors
   - malformed payloads

5. `Observability Failures`
   - Snapshot timeout
   - Dashboard render errors
   - Log sink configuration failure

### 14.2 Recovery Behavior

- Dispatch validation failures:
  - Skip new dispatches.
  - Keep service alive.
  - Continue reconciliation where possible.

- Worker failures:
  - Convert to retries with exponential backoff.

- Tracker candidate-fetch failures:
  - Skip this tick.
  - Try again on next tick.

- Reconciliation state-refresh failures:
  - Keep current workers.
  - Retry on next tick.

- Dashboard/log failures:
  - Do not crash the orchestrator.

### 14.3 Partial State Recovery (Restart)

Current design is intentionally in-memory for scheduler state.
Restart recovery means the service can resume useful operation by polling tracker state and reusing
preserved workspaces. It does not mean retry timers, running sessions, or live worker state survive
process restart.

After restart:

- No retry timers are restored from prior process memory.
- No running sessions are assumed recoverable.
- Service recovers by:
  - startup terminal workspace cleanup
  - fresh polling of active issues
  - re-dispatching eligible work

### 14.4 Executor Intervention Points

Executors can control behavior by:

- Editing `.aiur/config` (runtime settings) or its referenced `prompt_file:` (prompt).
- `.aiur/config` and `prompt_file:` changes are detected and re-applied automatically without restart
  according to Section 6.2.
- Changing issue states in the tracker:
  - terminal state -> running session is stopped and workspace cleaned when reconciled
  - non-active state -> running session is stopped without cleanup
- Restarting the service for process recovery or deployment (not as the normal path for applying
  workflow config changes).

## 15. Security and Operational Safety

### 15.1 Trust Boundary Assumption

Each implementation defines its own trust boundary.

Operational safety requirements:

- Implementations SHOULD state clearly whether they are intended for trusted environments, more
  restrictive environments, or both.
- Implementations SHOULD state clearly whether they rely on auto-approved actions, Executor
  approvals, stricter sandboxing, or some combination of those controls.
- Workspace isolation and path validation are important baseline controls, but they are not a
  substitute for whatever approval and sandbox policy an implementation chooses.

### 15.2 Filesystem Safety Requirements

Mandatory:

- Workspace path MUST remain under configured workspace root.
- Coding-agent cwd MUST be the per-issue workspace path for the current run.
- Workspace directory names MUST use sanitized identifiers.

RECOMMENDED additional hardening for ports:

- Run under a dedicated OS user.
- Restrict workspace root permissions.
- Mount workspace root on a dedicated volume if possible.

### 15.3 Secret Handling

- Support `$VAR` indirection in workflow config.
- Do not log API tokens or secret env values.
- Validate presence of secrets without printing them.

### 15.4 Hook Script Safety

Workspace hooks are arbitrary shell scripts from `.aiur/config`.

Implications:

- Hooks are fully trusted configuration.
- Hooks run inside the workspace directory.
- Hook output SHOULD be truncated in logs.
- Hook timeouts are REQUIRED to avoid hanging the orchestrator.

### 15.5 Harness Hardening Guidance

Running Codex agents against repositories, issue trackers, and other inputs that can contain
sensitive data or externally-controlled content can be dangerous. A permissive deployment can lead
to data leaks, destructive mutations, or full machine compromise if the agent is induced to execute
harmful commands or use overly-powerful integrations.

Implementations SHOULD explicitly evaluate their own risk profile and harden the execution harness
where appropriate. This specification intentionally does not mandate a single hardening posture, but
implementations SHOULD NOT assume that tracker data, repository contents, prompt inputs, or tool
arguments are fully trustworthy just because they originate inside a normal workflow.

Possible hardening measures include:

- Tightening Codex approval and sandbox settings described elsewhere in this specification instead
  of running with a maximally permissive configuration.
- Adding external isolation layers such as OS/container/VM sandboxing, network restrictions, or
  separate credentials beyond the built-in Codex policy controls.
- Filtering which Linear issues, projects, teams, labels, or other tracker sources are eligible for
  dispatch so untrusted or out-of-scope tasks do not automatically reach the agent.
- Narrowing the `linear_graphql` tool so it can only read or mutate data inside the
  intended project scope, rather than exposing general workspace-wide tracker access.
- Reducing the set of client-side tools, credentials, filesystem paths, and network destinations
  available to the agent to the minimum needed for the workflow.

The correct controls are deployment-specific, but implementations SHOULD document them clearly and
treat harness hardening as part of the core safety model rather than an optional afterthought.

## 18. Implementation Checklist (Definition of Done)

Use the same validation profiles as Section 17:

- Section 18.1 = `Core Conformance`
- Section 18.2 = `Extension Conformance`
- Section 18.3 = `Real Integration Profile`

### 18.1 REQUIRED for Conformance

- Config path selection supports explicit runtime path and cwd default
- `.aiur/config` loader with YAML config + optional `prompt_file:` template resolution
- Typed config layer with defaults and `$` resolution
- Dynamic `.aiur/config` (and `prompt_file:`) watch/reload/re-apply for config and prompt
- Polling orchestrator with single-authority mutable state
- Issue tracker client with candidate fetch + state refresh + terminal fetch
- Workspace manager with sanitized per-issue workspaces
- Workspace lifecycle hooks (`after_create`, `before_run`, `after_run`, `before_remove`)
- Hook timeout config (`hooks.timeout_ms`, default `60000`)
- Coding-agent app-server subprocess client with JSON line protocol
- Codex launch command config (`codex.command`, default `codex app-server`)
- Strict prompt rendering with `issue` and `attempt` variables
- Exponential retry queue with continuation retries after normal exit
- Configurable retry backoff cap (`agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`, default 5m)
- Reconciliation that stops runs on terminal/non-active tracker states
- Workspace cleanup for terminal issues (startup sweep + active transition)
- Structured logs with `issue_id`, `issue_identifier`, and `session_id`
- Executor-visible observability (structured logs; OPTIONAL snapshot/status surface)

### 18.2 RECOMMENDED Extensions (Not REQUIRED for Conformance)

- HTTP server extension honors CLI `--port` over `server.port`, uses a safe default bind host, and
  exposes the baseline endpoints/error semantics in Section 13.7 if shipped.
- `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension exposes raw Linear GraphQL access through the
  app-server session using configured Aiur auth.
- TODO: Persist retry queue and session metadata across process restarts.
- TODO: Make observability settings configurable in `.aiur/config` without prescribing UI
  implementation details.
- TODO: Add first-class tracker write APIs (comments/state transitions) in the orchestrator instead
  of only via agent tools.
- TODO: Add pluggable issue tracker adapters beyond Linear.

### 18.3 Operational Validation Before Production (RECOMMENDED)

- Run the `Real Integration Profile` from Section 17.8 with valid credentials and network access.
- Verify hook execution and workflow path resolution on the target host OS/shell environment.
- If the OPTIONAL HTTP server is shipped, verify the configured port behavior and loopback/default
  bind expectations on the target environment.
