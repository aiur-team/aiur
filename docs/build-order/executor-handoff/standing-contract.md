## Start gate (historical contract; explicitly overridden for this run)

The operator-authorized override and live execution state above are now the
authority for this run. Do not attempt to recreate a fresh pre-execution OPEN
snapshot after runtime labels and lifecycle transitions have begun. The
remaining text in this section records the intended immutable ceremony and is
useful for fixing the publisher, but it is not a reason to pause the authorized
Phase 1 workers.

This handoff becomes executable only after the live Build Order root contains a
uniquely marked immutable pending `aiur-build-order-reconciliation` comment and
one distinct canonical successful comment linking a post-publication receipt
whose exact commit contains both valid
reconciliations, both external gates below are recorded as resolved, and the
operator's current conditional run authorization remains in force. No second
approval prompt is required after those conditions pass. Re-run the trusted
final-comment verifier;
neither caller-supplied identity or query JSON, Git object substitution,
imported foreign history, nor a merely local/API-visible commit is a start
gate. The verifier anchors the repository to the configured GitHub origin,
fetches the exact receipt-recorded pending comment ID, rejects malformed or
duplicate reconciliation evidence, and proves approval plus receipt
remain ancestors of the unchanged tip of the frozen branch while separately
proving approval is an ancestor of receipt. It rejects legacy graft entries in
both the worktree and common Git directories, and all authority API reads pin
`github.com` with finite timeouts. The frozen branch ref is
`refs/heads/build-order-research`. Deletion or a force-push that removes
either commit revokes this gate; never substitute `main`, a pull ref, or a tag.
Planning publication does not queue work. Until then, do not run Aiur,
implement tickets, or add `agent:todo`.

The finite authorized boundary is the one consolidated 54-member BO+DASH
graph. Publish and dispatch only those members after the verifier and gates;
every member retains the exact `model:codex-gpt-5.6-terra` label, with no model
substitution.

The immutable receipt and final verifier attest the publication-finalization
snapshot: all 56 issues are open and unlocked, have their receipt-bound
titles/bodies/full labels, the root has exactly 54 children, every
non-root has no children, and all 107 blockers are exact. Run that full verifier
immediately before the first execution mutation. Once the authorized run
begins, later lifecycle changes are legitimate runtime truth and do not rewrite
the receipt: gate resolution may update live issues, the skill-delivery issue
may close, and member issues may acquire `agent:*` labels. Record and resolve both
external gates while the skill issue is still open; only after both gates are
proven may the Executor close the skill issue and dispatch member work. Never close
the skill issue or add dispatch labels first and then attempt to use the now
historical OPEN receipt as though it were a fresh publication snapshot.

## Identity and objective

- Build Order: `aiur-team/aiur:build-order-dashboard`
- Plan version: 1
- Repository: `aiur-team/aiur`
- Researched commit: `9849f32963c2a65367bce565b3f5ede3777c218f`
- Approved planning commit: `4d8de9508206e08e314f2730cd916501a3b4cafd`
- GitHub root: marker-resolved #1084 at pending publication; always re-resolve
  live by the hidden Build Order root marker rather than trusting a copied
  number

Deliver the consolidated 54-ticket program: the authenticated,
GitHub-planning-read-only Build Order feature plus the dashboard companion
members, all direct children of one root (operator decision 2026-07-13).
GitHub owns current plan facts; Aiur owns runtime facts. Linear #1067,
skill-delivery work and deferred findings remain outside the root and cannot
change this run's 54-member denominator or ETA.

## Required startup

1. Read these repository-relative paths in order:
   - `docs/build-order/README.md`
   - `docs/brainstorms/2026-07-12-build-order-requirements.md`
   - `docs/build-order/05-technical-decisions.md`
   - `docs/build-order/build-order.json`
   - every `tickets[].document` path in
     `docs/build-order/build-order.json` (BO-001 through BO-020 under
     `tickets/` and DASH-001 through DASH-034 under `companion-tickets/`)
   - `docs/build-order/validation-report.md`
   - `docs/build-order/github-publication.md`
2. Use `/aiur-run`, not the retired `/aiur-loop` workflow. Require reviewed
   PR #1065 source head `6447f9c193d2322d63f54a58b9c54e0a72d3e98f` and
   squash-merged `main` commit `ed1846c4bc76d4657095da57951a0dbf3e914c3d`
   to be recorded, and verify the landed skills preserve multi-prefix
   validation, finite-boundary, review/rework, circuit-breaker, and publication
   rules. A matching skill name without the recorded authority is insufficient.
3. Write a three-to-five-sentence `/goal` stating that you are the Executor,
   the finite acceptance boundary, granted issue/merge authority, critical-path
   priority and terminal condition.
4. The receipt-bound full live verifier was superseded for this run by the
   explicit root override recorded in the live-state section. The Executor
   re-queried repository instructions, set the isolated operator config to
   `tracker.base_branch: main`, and verified current integration truth before
   dispatch. Never use planning JSON as fresher live GitHub truth.
5. Queue only approved members of the consolidated root under explicit user
   authority. The shared
   predecessor baseline is recorded as resolved (`origin/main` at
   `9849f32963c2a65367bce565b3f5ede3777c218f`), and any ticket-specific
   provider gate (GATE-003 on DASH-019, GATE-004 on DASH-013) must still be
   resolved before those tickets are pickable.

## External pre-dispatch gates

- **GATE-001 — integration baseline (RESOLVED):** the predecessor OCC run is
  complete and the baseline is resolved — `origin/main` at
  `9849f32963c2a65367bce565b3f5ede3777c218f` contains closed #1034 plus every
  accepted OCC successor. Record that resolved branch and SHA on the live
  root; do not silently implement against any earlier snapshot.
- **GATE-002 — Executor skill:** record reviewed source head
  `6447f9c193d2322d63f54a58b9c54e0a72d3e98f` and landed `main` commit
  `ed1846c4bc76d4657095da57951a0dbf3e914c3d`, then confirm `/aiur-build`,
  `/aiur-run`, and `/aiur-monitor` are discoverable. The separate human
  skill-delivery issue remains outside the Build Order denominator.

GATE-001 and GATE-002 are resolved for execution; the skill-delivery issue was
closed under the operator's explicit receipt override before Phase 1 dispatch.
BO-004 and BO-008 are the independent initial nodes. BO-001 follows BO-004.

Record GATE-001's resolution and resolve GATE-002 before changing the skill
issue from its publication-finalization OPEN state. Close that issue only after the
installed bounded skill is proven, and only afterward add dispatch state to
ready BO issues under the user's execution authority.

## Authority map

- GitHub: root/member identity, title/body, planning labels, lifecycle/state
  reason and native blockers.
- Aiur: running/queued/retry/paused state, progress, active agent stage, alerts,
  events and latest evidence.
- Planning pack: approved requirements, technical decisions, ticket contracts,
  initial scheduling/conflict metadata, validation and finite boundary.
- Executor: current readiness/capacity, review/rework routing, merge policy
  under authority, recovery, status and final proof.

Unknown/stale provider data never becomes empty, ready, successful or zero.
Aiur progress, including 100%, never clears a GitHub blocker.

## Initial graph and capacity

After both external gates resolve, start BO-004, BO-008, DASH-006, DASH-017,
and DASH-018 in parallel. BO-001
and BO-017 follow BO-004. BO-002 follows BO-001; BO-003 follows BO-002; BO-005
follows BO-017. BO-003, BO-005, BO-016, and BO-019 serialize on the
application-supervision seam wherever hard dependencies do not already order
them; BO-005 also serializes with DASH-029 on observation-envelope
consumption. BO-006 follows BO-005. BO-007 follows BO-001, BO-003, and BO-005.
BO-009 follows BO-001 and BO-008; BO-010 follows BO-008 and BO-009. BO-016
follows BO-004 and owns configured-repository ticket detail. BO-019 follows
BO-005 and owns bounded sanitized recent history. BO-018 follows BO-008,
BO-016, and BO-019 and owns accessible base context. BO-011 follows BO-007 and
BO-018 and adds Build Order relationships and truthful destination links.
BO-012 follows BO-003, BO-007, BO-010, and BO-011; BO-013 follows BO-008 and
BO-012; BO-014 follows BO-008 and BO-013. BO-020 follows BO-003 and BO-012 and
serializes with BO-013/BO-014 on the shared Build Order route surface. BO-015
follows BO-006, BO-014, BO-020, DASH-023, and DASH-033.

The DASH members carry the same in-graph serialization: DASH-001 with BO-012
on the OCC route/navigation shell, DASH-023 with BO-013/014 on the Build
Order route surface, and
DASH-029 with BO-005. DASH-018/019 serialize on the Claude process-lifecycle
adapter. DASH-004/019 depend on BO-004's configured-repository identity. The
eight supervised member services—DASH-002/009/012/018/019/024/025/026—also
declare every independently ready serialization pair
against BO-003/005/016/019 on the central application supervision tree. Hard
dependencies already order the omitted pairs.

Derive current readiness from GitHub native blockers, ticket lifecycle,
declared serialization and real capacity. Phase is only a rollout/display hint.
Maximize progress against ready critical-path work, not raw active count. Do not
activate deferred findings to keep slots busy.

## Review, rework and convergence

- Review each PR against its issue contract, decisions and current base. Use
  parallel independent code review where useful.
- Return a contained finding to the same ticket/worker through rework and the
  event bus. Do not multiply tickets to preserve PR momentum.
- Promote a new issue only for an independent P0/P1 acceptance blocker. Record
  P2/P3 and optimization evidence in the deferred ledger.
- At each status interval compare completed versus created/promoted work. If
  promotion exceeds completion, freeze further promotion until the original
  feature lands.
- Keep branches current, CI green and shared-write work sequenced. Merge only
  under the user's current authority and repository policy.

Report two tracks separately: bounded Build Order critical path/count/ETA, and
reliability/optimization findings as active only when separately authorized or
otherwise deferred. Deferred work cannot consume critical-path capacity or
prevent completion.

## Operational playbook (field-proven in the OCC run)

These patterns come from the predecessor dashboard run that shipped the OCC
wave; the full version lives at
`docs/operator-control-center/EXECUTOR-HANDOFF.md` on branch `occ-planning`.

- **Merge gates, every time:** verify the PR's `baseRefName` is the
  configured integration branch before merging (agents build stacked PRs — a
  mis-based squash lands in the wrong branch silently), and run
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<base> origin/<branch>` (a green PR
  can be green against a stale base). Merge with `--squash --admin`; the
  known seed-dependent SlotPolicy flake (#506) is mergeable-past when
  build/lint/dialyzer are green. Closing merged issues is manual.
- **Unstick with a message, not resume:** a paused/idle worker that is not
  converging (frozen HEAD, no file edits, not load-throttled, not
  attention-flagged) needs `scripts/aiurdev message <id> "<directive>"` to
  inject a real turn; resume alone re-pauses. Post durable directives as
  issue comments — message-queue text is lost on restart.
- **Finalization wedge:** a worker that committed but never pushes gets its
  work pushed by you from its workspace once the tree is clean; its own later
  push becomes a no-op.
- **Compress the finish line:** identify the single authoritative failure per
  head and send one exact packet. A branch with committed scoped source and
  only generated dirt should push after the reproducing test; the owning
  worker must resolve a current-main merge or re-cut, run its focused conflict
  suite, and push; an
  already-invalid CI head should not wait for unrelated jobs. Centralized CI
  owns the full gate, and two independent exact-head reviews start together
  only after the worker's head contains current main and that gate passes. Do
  not run duplicate local full suites, do not
  repeatedly merge a moving `main` during implementation, and do not split a
  converged review packet into serial mini-heads. The final ancestry check,
  fresh CI, and dual review remain mandatory.
- **Escalate ownership when convergence fails:** return the first lint,
  Dialyzer, stale-base, conflict, or review repair to the owning worker as one
  bounded packet. Then inspect long-running tickets, repeated cold dispatches
  or restarts, ownerless open PRs, frozen heads, repeated review/rework cycles,
  recurring base/conflict repair, and non-shrinking CI failures. If one bounded
  recovery cycle does not produce material progress, the owner disappears, or
  direct completion is reasonably faster and safer, stop duplicate writers and
  take over under the recorded authority. Catastrophic Aiur failure is not
  required. Use an isolated worktree, preserve the worker branch/workspace and
  acceptance boundary, defer nits, and record the evidence and outcome.
- **Restarts are branch-safe:** the checkout logic re-fetches an existing
  remote ticket branch, so recycling a wedged worker (bloated thread,
  CI-poll loop) loses only the unproductive turn, never committed work.
- **Old-branch skill-path collisions:** an older ticket branch can collide
  with turn-injected skill paths when merging the newly landed skill commit.
  Pause that worker, clean only artifacts verified as injected, merge current
  `main`, restore the tracked tree, and only then resume it.
- **Capacity:** track real CPU (`vmstat` id%), not 1-minute load; the
  observed thrash ceiling is ~8–11 concurrent agents on a 12-core box with
  `max_concurrent_builds: 2` as the true protector. Ramp `set max-agents`
  into measured idle, not optimism.
- **Review discipline:** dual review (correctness + adversarial) on every
  substantive PR, front-loaded in parallel; only `must_fix_before_merge`
  findings block a merge — downgrade the rest to the deferred ledger. Drive
  rework with `gh issue comment` (issue_comment), not `gh pr review`.
- **Hygiene:** commit subjects 3–7 word imperative, no AI/model mentions or
  attribution trailers anywhere; never edit `src/test/aiur/regression/`;
  patch labels via the REST API when `gh issue edit` hits the
  classic-Projects GraphQL error; never paste credentials into files,
  commands, or issues.

## Recovery and Aiur defects

Monitor workers, alerts, Commands, PRs, reviews, CI and machine capacity. First
message/retry or return the owning worker one consolidated recovery packet.
Take over a critical ticket when that bounded recovery does not restore
material progress, the PR loses its live owner, the same cycle repeats, or an
evidence-backed Executor judgment finds takeover to be the economical path.

Later-phase Ad Hoc issue #1182 adds advisory configuration for this watch:
`executor_takeover_first_alert_hours: 8` followed by recurring
`executor_takeover_continuous_alert_hours: 1` prompts. It has no `agent:todo`
and cannot delay the current started-PR drain or Build Order acceptance.

With debug authorization, file a sanitized Aiur issue for a reproducible Aiur
failure. Without it, ask the user first. Always remove credentials, tokens,
private content, account identifiers, environment values, local paths/hosts and
irrelevant source context.

## Terminal condition

Stop only when all 54 members — BO-001 through BO-020 and DASH-001 through
DASH-034 — are implemented, reviewed, green on the
current configured integration branch, merged, documented, cleaned up and
proven after merge.

BO-015 owns the acceptance matrix, real published-root dogfood, synthetic
cycle/invalid/degraded/20/50/100 fixtures and post-merge smoke, and closes the
root only after DASH-033's dashboard-parity proof and the Build Order
acceptance evidence both land. The Executor
runs the canonical real CLI/TUI flow from the Executor repository root because
issue workspaces cannot bypass the `--test` guard. Proof also covers the
authenticated browser, selection/deep links, LKG degradation, live activity,
context/dependency navigation, keyboard/touch/pan/zoom, light/dark/reduced
motion, mobile safe area, 200% zoom and preservation of Units, Commands and
Analytics.

After proof, BO-015 closes the GitHub root with state reason `COMPLETED`. The
loop ends there; it does not continue until every discovered reliability or
optimization opportunity is exhausted.

## Adjacent delivery that must not be lost

PR #1065 delivered the isolated `/aiur-build` and bounded Executor skill
rewrite. Its final reviewed source head is
`6447f9c193d2322d63f54a58b9c54e0a72d3e98f`; it was squash-merged to `main`
as `ed1846c4bc76d4657095da57951a0dbf3e914c3d`. Record both commits and verify
the landed skills before dispatch. Never merge mixed research PR #1064 merely
to recover skill files already present on `main`.
