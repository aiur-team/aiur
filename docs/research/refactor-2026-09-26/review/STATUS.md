# Status: partial, not synthesized

The code review stopped early on 2026-09-26: first the account session limit was hit, then Claude credits ran out.

- `raw/` holds 23 of 32 review units, one JSON file per unit. Each file lists its findings with severity, locations, evidence and recommendation.
- Units still incomplete: tests-1a, tests-1b, tests-4, nonelixir-web, skills-prompts, and the four cross-cutting duplication sweeps (by name, by body, by concept, by constant).
- Not verified: no P0/P1 finding has had its skeptic check yet. Treat every severity as the reviewer's own claim.
- Not written yet: `code-review.md`, `findings.json`, `by-boundary.md`.

## Website continuation checkpoint

`in-progress/nonelixir-web.json` records full reads of the 16 website files in
the 178-file unit. The other 162 paths remain unreviewed in this continuation.
Three P2 findings have isolated source probes: a false-passing reduced-motion
check, a readiness deadline that cannot cancel its in-flight request, and copy
feedback that does not wait for clipboard success. These are additional
provisional findings, outside the 853 inherited findings in `raw/`.

Reproduce with Node 24:

```sh
node tooling/website_review_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot
```

The probe transpiles source into a disposable temporary directory, checks the
baseline and a broken freeze-offset mutation, and uses controlled browser API
doubles for the other two cases. It does not launch a browser or Aiur. It is
research evidence, not manual UX verification. Output is retained in
`in-progress/website-review-probe.json`; each input carries a SHA-256 hash.
No production implementation changed. This partial unit is deliberately not
counted among the 23 raw unit artifacts.

## Stream Deck lifecycle continuation

The same partial unit now records 45 complete file reads: the 16 website paths
plus 29 Stream Deck source, test and configuration paths. There are 133 paths
remaining. Two additional P2 findings concern duplicate monitor restart chains
and removal events from a different product of the same vendor. Five provisional
findings now sit outside the inherited `raw/` totals.

```sh
node tooling/streamdeck_lifecycle_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot
```

On Linux with Node 24, the probe confirms that a genuinely absent executable
produces both error and close notifications, then drives the frozen runtime with
injected timers and device/monitor doubles. One failure schedules two replacements;
cleanup loses ownership of one child or timer. A same-vendor, different-product
removal also closes a healthy backend and leaves no reopen timer. Results are in
`in-progress/streamdeck-lifecycle-probe.json`. These are conditional source-level
reproductions, not hardware testing or estimates of incident frequency.

The pure device reducer already separates idle reads, disconnects, suspend and
bounded recovery. Preserve that seam in planning. The demonstrated gaps concern
monitor termination ownership and device identity at the event adapter boundary.

## Channel and command continuation

The partial unit now has 54/178 complete reads, 124 remaining paths, and eight
provisional P2 findings. The nine added reads cover the channel, controller,
command model, voice session, selected complete tests and HID report helpers.
The much larger controller test file remains only partially reviewed; the JSON
coverage notes identify the ranges read.

```sh
node tooling/streamdeck_channel_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot
```

The probe demonstrates text loss on an offline Send press, `QUEUED` state on an
offline Implement press, ignored server errors for `say`/`control`, and no cursor
request when history navigation reaches the first eight-item server page. An
answer-command error is the positive control: it does reach its error callback.
Input travels through the actual controller's HID decoder. The channel uses a
synthetic socket; the surface contributes only its unchanged `agentLess`
predicate, so these checks do not claim pixel, hardware or live-service coverage.

Preserve the existing server ownership of delivery, queueing and durable Command
answers. The missing client contracts are acceptance receipts, retained pending
intent and cursor-driven history navigation. A new package boundary alone would
not repair them.

## Audio completion continuation

The partial web/Stream Deck unit now records 71/178 complete reads, with 107
paths remaining and ten provisional P2 findings. Seventeen added full reads
cover audio adapters/contracts and the voice-host/relay tests. A composed
source probe demonstrates two boundary defects: release seals transcript
delivery before the server's requested final can arrive; overlapping holds
consume a delayed start reply without retaining its originating hold identity.
Earlier settled text survives the first case. The second needs only ordered,
delayed replies; server-side session guards can discard the mislabelled audio.

Reproduce with `node tooling/streamdeck_audio_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot`.
Results and source hashes are in `review/in-progress/streamdeck-audio-probe.json`.
The capture and channel are injected ports; no hardware, provider or daemon was
run. No production files changed. Continue with audio tests, playback/cancellation
candidates, rendering and the remaining controller tests. Raw review coverage
remains 23/32, and claim coverage remains 50/60; this is still a partial unit.

## Audio resource checkpoint

All audio source and test paths in the partial unit have now been read: 21
additional complete reads bring coverage to 92/178, leaving 86 paths. The unit
has thirteen provisional findings (eleven P2 and two P3), still outside raw
review totals. A real bounded child flushes bytes on SIGINT through the actual
Node adapter, but capture/session discard the tail before transcription. This
is separate from finding 09's discarded final transcript after upload.

`node tooling/streamdeck_audio_resource_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot`
reproduces that drain failure, playback's unresolved write after sink failure,
and the fetch iterator's missing body cancellation. Results are retained in
`review/in-progress/streamdeck-audio-resource-probe.json`. Playback/TTS symbols
have no production callers in the frozen repository search and are absent from
the audio barrel: their two findings are latent P3 defects, with no claimed
live device or quota impact. The whole directory also includes provider-shaped
TTS code with an outward import, despite its narrower barrel's extraction claim.
Resolve that scope before treating the directory as an independent package.

No hardware, provider, daemon or package suite was run; this was source review
and targeted probe execution. Next review work is rendering, voice-panel host
wiring, controller tests and remaining scripts/configuration. Overall claim
coverage stays 50/60 and completed raw review units stay 23/32.

## Surface state checkpoint

Seventeen additional full reads bring the partial unit to 109/178 files,
leaving 69. Finding 14 reproduces a wrong active-microphone caption when the
selected device is outside the visible settings page: the compositor emits
Mic 7, Mic 0, Mic 7 for page offsets 6, 0, 6 with Mic 7 selected throughout.
The recording rasterizer proves the panel model, not pixels or hardware.
Reproduce with `node tooling/streamdeck_surface_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot`;
results are in `review/in-progress/streamdeck-surface-probe.json`.

The reviewed key cache/write queue already protects pending versus committed
content, partial writes and fresh-writer recovery. Preserve those contracts.
Strip cache/signature state is eager, but production recovery invalidates on
backend replacement; no permanent stale-pixel claim is established yet.
Typewriter row identity and role filtering remain candidates requiring caller
analysis. Continue with remaining surface/controller tests, renderers and
scripts. Fourteen partial-unit findings (twelve P2, two P3) are not included in
the inherited raw totals; overall counts remain 23/32 units and 50/60 claims.

## Provider contract checkpoint

All touchStrip source/test paths are now read: eighteen additional paths bring
the partial unit to 127/178, leaving 51. Finding 15 identifies producer-consumer
drift: the server emits semantic session/weekly slots without durations, while
the client reclassifies by duration. A real two-window shape becomes no data; a
weekly-only shape becomes session usage. The client tests use an older shape.

`node tooling/streamdeck_provider_probe.mjs /path/to/frozen-snapshot` checks
the producer's source-level output keys and executes the actual client model
against synthetic values in that shape, with the old shape as a positive
control. The server is source-traced, not executed, and no live prevalence is
claimed. Results are in `review/in-progress/streamdeck-provider-probe.json`.
A shared serialized contract fixture is needed across the proposed boundary.

Provider painter freshness/age handling remains a candidate for the complete
art-renderer pass. The report-encoding benchmark already disclaims hardware
latency coverage; do not promote its fourfold arithmetic into measured savings.
Fifteen partial-unit findings (thirteen P2, two P3) remain outside raw totals.
Overall counts remain 23/32 review units and 50/60 claims. Continue with art,
key rendering, logs/controller tests and scripts; no production changes made.
